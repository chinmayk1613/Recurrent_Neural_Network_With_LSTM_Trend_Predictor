Recurrent Neural Network


Sometimes we required to remember the data or result from previous or past
actions on which current decisions might get impacted. When we are under the relm
of Machine Learning, vanila neural networks learn the things during the training.
Recurrent Neural Network learn the exactly same as the vanila networks learn, but in additon
they remember the things learned from the previous input while learning from current input.

Lont-Short Term Memory(LSTM)


LSTM's are special kind of RNN which is capable of long-term learning dependecies.
