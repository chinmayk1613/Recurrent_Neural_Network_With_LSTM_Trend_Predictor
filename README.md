Recurrent Neural Network


Sometimes we required to remember the data or result from previous or past actions on which current decisions might get impacted. When we are under the realm of Machine Learning, vanilla neural networks learn the things during the training. Recurrent Neural Network learn the exactly same as the vanilla networks learn, but in addition they remember the things learned from the previous input while learning from current input.


Lont-Short Term Memory(LSTM)


LSTM's are special kind of RNN which is capable of long-term learning dependencies. LSTM's main aim is to remembering the information for long time and hence it will input in a learning process. LSTM have chain like structure which have different structure than standard neural networks. LSTM has four layered structure which they can interact in a special way. There are three gates namely Forget Gate, Input Gate and Output Gate through which information is regulated. Cell state is act like conveyer belt which carry information with very minor changes in LTSM.
